# Sketches

Sketches are small code experiments often exploring [creative coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding). This repo contains the sketches I publish on [jack.kiwi](https://jack.kiwi). Many of them will be built with [P5.js](https://p5js.org). Check out the script.js files in each project folder the code.
